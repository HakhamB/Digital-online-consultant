>LDL,>LDL stands for low-density lipoproteins.  It is also known as âbadâ cholesterol.   LDL is one of the two types of lipoproteins that carry cholesterol throughout your body.  A high LDL level leads to a buildup of cholesterol in your arteries. 
>Metabolism,>Metabolism is the process your body uses to get or make energy from the food you eat.
>Monounsaturated Fat,">Monounsaturated fat is a type of fat is found in avocados, canola oil, nuts, olives and olive oil, and seeds. Eating food that has more monounsaturated fat (or ""healthy fat"") instead of saturated fat (like butter) may help lower cholesterol and reduce heart disease risk. However, monounsaturated fat has the same number of calories as other types of fat and may contribute to weight gain if you eat too much of it."
>Nutrient,">Nutrients are chemical compounds in food that are used by the body to function properly and maintain health. Examples include proteins, fats, carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals."
>Nutrition,">This field of study focuses on foods and substances in foods that help animals (and plants) to grow and stay healthy. Nutrition science also includes behaviors and social factors related to food choices. The foods we eat provide energy (calories) and nutrients such as protein, fat, carbohydrate, vitamins, minerals, and water. Eating healthy foods in the right amounts gives your body energy to perform daily activities, helps you to maintain a healthy body weight, and can lower your risk for certain diseases such as diabetes and heart disease.Â  "
>Polyunsaturated Fat,">Polyunsaturated fat is a type of fat that is liquid at room temperature. There are two types of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs): omega-6 and omega-3.
